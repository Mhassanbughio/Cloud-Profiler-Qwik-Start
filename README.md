# Cloud-Profiler-Qwik-Start
Overview Cloud Profiler is a statistical, low-overhead profiler that continuously gathers CPU usage and memory-allocation information from your production applications. It attributes that information to the application's source code, helping you identify the parts of the application consuming the most resources, and otherwise illuminating the performance characteristics of the code.  In this lab you will learn how to set up and use Stackdriver Profiler. First you'll download a sample Go program and run it with profiling enabled. Then you'll use the Cloud Profiler interface to explore the captured data.
